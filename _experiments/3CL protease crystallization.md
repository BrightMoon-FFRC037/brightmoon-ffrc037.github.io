# Introduction
This is the experiment of Protein Crystallization.
It should be noted that the series of experiments were performed under the background of 3CL protease. 
However, for convenience, in crystallization process we used lysozyme instead of 3CL protease for learning. 
The title is kept as 3CL protease just for consistence.
