## Introduction
As the saying goes:

 >"Knowledge is experiment's daughter." Leonardo da Vinci, 1492

Why the mechanism of the world can be understand and can be explain by our knowledge and theory? That's a significant question.

The validation of our human's knowledge, especially natural science, is completely based on experiments. 

* It is experiment that persuade us the theory does work in practical situation.
* It is experiment that set physics, chemistry and biology apart from mathematics (pure maths) which is a large dedective system from my point of view.
* It is experiment that **bridge the gap between theories and objective world.**

I value every opportunity to carry out experiments in laboritary. This reopsitory containing some of my experiment reports is for recording those valuble moments and sharing it.
