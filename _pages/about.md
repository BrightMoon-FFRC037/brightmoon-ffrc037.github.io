# About Me
As the student of Integrated Science Program(ISP), I have abroad taste focusing on **Biology** while including **Physics**, **Chemistry**, **Mathematics**, **Electrical Engineering**, **Computer Science**, etc. 

What is Integrated Science?

While my classmates may give various answers, I view it as the study of biology using interdisciplinary methods and even developing novel toolkits for life science research. This an exciting but formidable prospect.

On the journey of inquiry and exploration in the field of scientific research, there are so many moments to be cherished and numerous thoughts worth sharing even if they seem to be naive. That's the inner motivation for me to set up the website.

# About the Website
The major documents can also be seen in my GitHub repositories, but I find the website a better place to display them visually.

Here are the four major sources(my GitHub repositories) of the content in this website:

1. [**Dissertations** (my short article on specific subjects)]({{"https://github.com/BrightMoon-FFRC037/Dissertations" | url_encode}})

2. [**Experiments** (mainly the reports of my experiments)]({{"https://github.com/BrightMoon-FFRC037/Experiment-Reports" | url_encode}})

3. [**Literature and Notes** (the literature I appreciate and notes for them)]({{"https://github.com/BrightMoon-FFRC037/Literature" | url_encode}})

4. [**Toolkit for Scientific Research** (the notes for getting started with them)]({{"https://github.com/BrightMoon-FFRC037/Toolkit-For-Scientific-Research" | url_encode}})

For detailed and complete information I suggest visiting the GitHub repository directly, while **here, just on the website, is the selective content for you.**

I have been trying to organize the website according to the four major sources accompanying with auxiliary parts(the homepage and the blog).

I have chosen the BrightMoon to be my avator, not only for pun or playword but also because of the enriched poetic image in Chinese culture.
