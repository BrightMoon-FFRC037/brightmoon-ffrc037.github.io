## Introduction
In a digital age, not only should we deal with tubes and agents in a traditional laboratory but also should get familiar with a set of softwares when it comes to do scientific research.

However, getting familiar with numerous softwares or toolkits is not easy given the well known forgetting curve, especially for a freshman to university and academia.

Hence, I decide to set up this repository for recording the procedures to get started with those toolkits mainly for myself while open to anyone else who share common interest with me.
